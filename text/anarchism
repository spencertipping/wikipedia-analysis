      ''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).
Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.
These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].
=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].
Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.
While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  
Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.
This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.
Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.
=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.
Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.
Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.
Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.
=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.
Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.
On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.
=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.
This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].
=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.
Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.
Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.
Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.
=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===
* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederaci√≥n National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].
